# Car_Price_Prediction_machine_learning

Hello #connections ! 👋 I'm excited to share that I've completed my project named Car Price Prediction using machine learning. 🚗💰

🔍 Data Exploration: I've analyzed a dataset and exploring various features like car dimensions, engine details, and more.

🚀 Data Preprocessing: I've cleaned the data, handled missing values.

📊 Correlation Analysis: I've visualized the correlation among features using a heatmap, understanding how they influence car prices.

📈 Machine Learning: I've implemented two powerful algorithms, Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression.

🔍 Feature Selection: I've also conducted feature selection to enhance model performance, ensuring we focus on the most impactful variables. 🎯

📊 Actual vs. Predicted: Check out a snippet of the actual vs. predicted car prices in the code! 📉
